                <h3>Science Olypiad "Robot Tour"</h3>
                <p>    This project was created to compete in the science olypiad Robot Tour event, where the goal was to have a 
                    completly autonomous robot pathfind a maze, passing through gates for bonus points in the process. using
                    an Arduino leonardo and an Arduino motor controler, I was able to run 2 weak brushed motors with an omni
                    wheel in the front to create robot that was able to turn in place. This was assembled into a 3d printed 
                    chasis and powered with 6 double A batteries. We also used rotary encoders on the wheels to help improve
                    the acuracy. The code was written in C using the arudino IDE, and is a complete mess. The primary 
                    function of the code was having a seprate functoin for each motion, allowing me to code the path the 
                    robot needed to take during the programming period. Although this robot was able to win some awards at
                    invitaitons, it was plagued with incosnsitcy and inacruacy. this event will return next year, I just
                    hope we can usre 12v then.</p>
