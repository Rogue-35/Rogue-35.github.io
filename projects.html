                <h3>Science Olympiad "Robot Tour"</h3>
                <p>This project was created to compete in the Science Olympiad Robot Tour event, where the goal was to have a completely autonomous robot path find a maze, passing through gates for bonus points in the process. Using an Arduino Leonardo and an Arduino motor controller, I was able to run 2 weak brushed motors with an omni-wheel in the front to create a robot that was able to turn in place. This was assembled into a 3d printed chassis and powered with 6 AA batteries. We also used rotary encoders on the wheels to help improve the accuracy. The code was written in C using the Arduino IDE, and is a complete mess. The primary purpose of the code was having a separate function for each motion, allowing me to code the path the robot needed to take during the programming period. Although this robot was able to win some awards at invitational, it was plagued with inconsistency and inaccuracy. this event will return next year, I just hope we can use 12v then</p>
